# Pandas_Challenge

# Python Pandas
Pandas is a powerful data analysis Python library. I have used Pandas Framework to analyse datasets on schools and students.

In this assignment, I have used the Pandas library to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I have analysed the district-wide standardized test results mainly the reading and math scores of students to uncover onbious trends in school performance.

The purpose of this project is to analyze district-wide standardized test results. Data is aggregated to show trends in school performance. The school board will be using these results to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.



The final report includes the following:

**District Summary** 
A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**School Summary**
An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per School Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**
A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per School Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Low Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**
A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

**Math Scores by Grade**
A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Reading Scores by Grade**
A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Scores by School Spending**
A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. The table includes each of the following:
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Scores by School Size**
Breakdown by grouping schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

**Scores by School Type**
Breakdown by grouping schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

- Schools with higher spending averages, has lower overall passing rate.
- Medium and small schools have higher overall passing rate compared to the larger schools.
- Finally Charter schools have higher overall passing rate than district schools.

As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student actually ($645-675) underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (<$585 per student).

As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
